# E-Commerce website with a mobile-first approach

I used this [design template](https://www.figma.com/design/itNlojnFpRJwGvosGzXSva/E-commerce-Website-Template--Freebie---Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=ic7IQe0HGlmUasUa-0), so it is not mine.
And for products, I used [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/).

## Details
During my development, I encountered many pitfalls. I have not found the API I wanted to use. I needed only clothes; however, there is no such API, at least I have not found it.
But I found a solution, and it was to filter all data. It is not a good idea, but I needed to just implement it. So then I encountered other obstacles, such a filtering products and so on.
In conclusion, I understood that using the approach I use for data is not a good idea, but anyway, it works.

## What I used here
- React + Vite
- Tailwind
- ShadcnUI
- Lucid Icons
- React Router DOM
